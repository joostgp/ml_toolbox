# Machine Learning Toolbox
This is my to-do list and reminder for sharing my machine learning toolbox. Right now my toolbox is undocumented and a mess. Hopefully this repo will remind me to actually properly document and test the code. I will upload my code after it has been properly document, one file at a time, in the following order.

# Properly documented code:
- kaggle.py: automatically create submissions files and upload them to Kaggle

#To do:
- classifier_analysis.py
- classifier.py
- dict.py
- list.py
- files.py
- general.py
- images.py
- numeric.py
- plot.py
- string.py
